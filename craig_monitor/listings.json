Parking on the street is very easy neighboring sea cliff and no permit is needed!  \n \n \nAbout Us:  \n \nAlexis is (28) originally from Washington, Jackie (26) originally from NY both work in corporate retail in Mission Bay. We are close friends who love exploring SF and live very active lifestyles. We love exploring outside the city as much as in the city. Enjoy trying new restaurants and bars on the weekend with friends and seeing live music around the city. When the weather is nice we enjoy hosting at the apt on the balcony barbecuing and having bonfires at Ocean Beach. What originally drew us to this space a year ago was how amazing the view was from the apt and how we were only a walk to the beach neighboring Lands' End along with Golden Gate Park. The neighborhood we live in has great food on Balboa Street and across the park on Judah there are delicious restaurants, tap rooms and cute shops. Our most recent roommate unfortunately is moving after a year to go back to school. Although we are very sad for him to leave we are excited and open to finding a new friend and resident to enjoy this wonderful space we love! \n \nThe apartment is available March 1st (can be flexible) and you will take on a lease until Jan 31st 2018.

There is a furnished living room and dining room, both with nice furnishings (basically what you see in the photos). The kitchen was recently remodeled and is fully stocked with high end pots/pans/appliances, including a dishwasher. There is on-site laundry (washer/dryer) in the large garage, which also has ample space for storage. A monthly housecleaner is already included in the rent. It also has a parking spot \n \nTHE ROOM \nIt's the master bedroom (200+ sq. ft.) with attached bathroom, beautiful windows and a huge closet. Your room has the option to come furnished with a bed, or it can come unfurnished. You'll get beautiful sunlight and it's very quiet, cozy, and well-ventilated. Also features original, refinished hardwood floors. \n \nTHE LOCATION \nWe're in a fantastic spot in Cole Valley, right along the N-Judah light rail, as well as the 43 and 6, 7 and 33 Muni bus lines. Shared on-site parking is available & street parking is not hard to find and permits are inexpensive. The neighborhood has popular cafes, bars/winebars, restaurants, pharmacies, groceries, etc., all within a few blocks plus we're just up the street from the buzzing nightlife of Upper Haight, relaxation in Golden Gate Park, and super close to Lower Haight and the Inner Sunset neighborhoods - we're in one of the safest areas in the city!

We're a Designer/foodie and tech product manager-turned org dev consultant/yogi. We're super clean, low key, fun, enjoy cooking things in our amazing kitchen every now and then, and like decompressing over a glass of wine. The place is so big that everyone gets their own space, especially with the garden. On the weekends, we're pretty active (rock climbing?), really into music, and like to get out in the surrounding nature and city life. \n \nTHE DETAILS  \nOur previous roommates (also our friends) are moving to Australia, which is why the room is available. We're looking for someone to move in on March 1st. Lease term is flexible, but we'd love a commitment of at least 8 months with the option to extend if you love it (and we think you will!). Typical utilities ~$70/person (water, power, garbage, internet) and security deposit + 1 month rent (returned upon departure) will also be required, but having fun in your new place is totally free. :) \n \nMessage us and we'll set up a time for you to come check it out!
